_That part of glider setup, the last thing to put on, right at the front of the hang glider wing, where the leading edges and keel join._  
The image is a screen grab from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P49uuEy2Fls) where Rohan Holtkamp of Dynamic Flight shows how to setup a floater hang glider.

## Frontends for Flare Timing

As a non-trivial way to try out tech I'm interested in I've reproduced a few pages from the flare timing front end (the nose cone 😉 ) as:
